<b>The Basics of the web</b>
<p>The web is a bunch of computers that communicate
  with each other. When a person goes to a web
  page like www.google.com, their computer sends
  a <em>HTTP Request</em> to a <em>server</em>. The
  server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends
  it back to the user's computer where a <em>web browser</em>
  interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.

  does a good job of explaining.
</p>

<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> This is the "heart of the web". HTML documents form the majority of the
  content on the web. <br>
  	○ Text content - what you see<br>
		○ Markup - what it looks like<br>
		○ References to other documents - images ,videos and Links to other pages<br>
</p>
<b>CSS</b>
<p><em>Cascading Sytle Sheets</em>-style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.
</p>
<b>What is CSS?</b>
<p>CSS is code written to control the "style" of HTML elements.</p>
<br>
<b>How does CSS "control" HTML?</b>
<p> You  "control" CSS by using { and }, Everything between these curly braces will be interpreted as a "rule" that should be applied to every  element identified prior to the first {.</p>
<br>
<b>Including CSS Styling</b>
<p>There are three ways to do it.<br>
1-Write CSS in the "head" of your HTML<br>
2-Link your HTML to a separate CSS file<br>
3-Write your style <em>inline</em> with your HTML<br>
</p>
<b>DOM</b>
<p><em>Document Object Model</em> - a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML (and other markup languages). The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree.
</p>

<b> HTML Vocabulary</b>
<p>
• <b><em>Tag</em></b>: An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag and a closing tag. Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag.<br>
• <b><em>Element</em></b>: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.<br>
• <b><em>Attribute</em></b>: This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to the AT&T URL, you would write <a href="www.att.com">href="www.att.com"</a>
</p>

<b>Tags and Elements</b>
<p>HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When
  writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>.
</p>

<b>Why Computers are Stupid</b>
<p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions
  literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a
  small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems
  in a program.
</p>

<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
  elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of
  them. 
</p>
<p>Some examples of <em>Inline elements</em> are br (line break), b (bold), em (emphasis), and img (image).
Some examples of <em>Block elements</em> are p (paragraph) and div.</p>
<br>
<b>Box Sizing</b>
<p>There are 4 main points.<br>
1-HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components.<br>
2-Because there are so many components to each box, it can often be hard to get the size of a box just right.<br>
3-There are 2 techniques to help deal with sizing issues. First set size in terms of percentages and second, set the <em>box-sizing</em> attribute to <em>border-box</em> for every element.<br>
4-Different browsers work slightly differently. Sometimes this causes different browsers to display the same code differently.<br>

<b>Tools</b>

<p>There are 3 tools we will use in this course:<br>

• <b><em>Scratchpad</em></b>: Good for Speed of Feedback and Ease of Use but not good for Ease of Sharing, Power/Professionalism and Number of languages.<br>
• <b><em>Codepen</em></b>: Great for Ease of Sharing. Okay for Speed of Feedback, Ease of Use, Power/Professionalism and Number of languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)<br>
• <b><em>Sublime</em></b>: Best for Power/Professionalism and Number of languages (all), okay for Ease of shareing but not good for Speed of Feedback or Ease of use.
